# Project Title

Finding your future fans

## Summary

Spotify's recommendation algorithm is a familiar concept to all of us. As a listener, we receive an infinite stream of new music that we are likely to enjoy. In this project, we aim to use AI to do the inverse process. As a singer or a band, it's essential to reach out to new listeners in order to grow your fan base. However, it can be challenging to know where to start. This project will provide insights into the type of people who enjoy your music and how to reach them effectively.

## Background

Starting a career in the music industry can be challenging, especially for new artists. It is crucial to understand the type of music you are performing and how it resonates with people. Knowing your fanbase is also important to improve communication on social media and during shows. However, most musicians tend to focus on producing new songs or other aspects of the artistic process, such as creating album art, filming music videos, or arranging concerts.

This tool can help artists in the following ways:
* Gain insight into how people perceive their music
* Understand their audience better
* Discover what their fans love
* Find inspiration for new material.


## How is it used?

Discovering new bands and their audience is made easy with this tool, similar to finding new artists on Spotify. Not only can an artist identify which bands have an audience that would appreciate their music, but they can also gain insights into their own audience's preferences. This includes interests beyond music such as clothing, films, and other hobbies. By using this tool, artists can stay up-to-date with current trends within their fanbase.


## Data sources and AI methods

We primarily utilize Spotify's open datasets that are available on platforms such as Kaggle. In addition, we require demographic datasets containing information on age, gender, geography, and earnings. Furthermore, we also need data on social media activity and artist interactions.


## Challenges

This kind of project to showcase an artist's audience can face challenges like:
*  _data quality_ It can be complicated to get all the data we need. Social media have restrictive policyes about sharing data.
*  _privacy_ New regulations can make difficult to get the data of the audience, because it can be sensitive.
*  _audience variability_ Fanbases are very volatile and constantly change due to factors unrelated to music, such as romances, artist statements, or cultural trends.

These challenges must be addressed for accurate and useful results.

## What next?

By focusing on these aspects, the project can expand its user base, improve user satisfaction, and grow the AI
* Improve the AI's recommendation algorithm to provide more accurate and relevant suggestions.
* Extend the AI's capabilities to analyze data from various platforms, not just music streaming services.
* Make the AI available to bands worldwide by incorporating multiple languages and cultural contexts
*Implementing a social network where artists can communicate directly with their potential audience
